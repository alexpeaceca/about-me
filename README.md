> - Quality Assurance Engineers (modern)
>   - Evaluate work products such as requirements, timelines, user stories, designs, and code.
>   - Ensure required coverage of the complete end to end test object.
>   - Reduce the level of risk of inadequate software quality (reduce risk, not ensure perfection).
>   - Verify requirements have been fulfilled.
>   - Verify the test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements.
>   - Provide information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions.
>   - Build confidence in the quality of the test object.
>   - Validate the test object is complete and works as the stakeholders expect it to.
>   - Trigger failures and find defects.

> 🖥️  ^ Sample Test Object - [Hacker News Clone](https://github.com/alexpeaceca/hackernews-remix-react ) (fork) (React, Remix, Typescript, Node)

> #### Test Coverage Features:
>
> - #### ✅ Testcases and Testcase Management Examples:
>   - Functional Testcases aligned to Page Objects.
>   - Simple, effective testcases. Ideally targeting a single unit of functionality.
>   - Page Object Model (pom) for Front-end Tests.
>   - Testcases are indexed and tagged, aligning to both Manaul Testcases and Automated Tests (grep).
>   - Testcases are in [CSV](https://github.com/alexpeaceca/hackernews-remix-react-tests/blob/main/cypress/cypress/testcases-csv/user_anon_page_landing.csv), formatted for quick import to Testcaes Management Tools (Testrail, etc.)
>   - Tests are designed to use dynamical generated test data where appicable (fakerJS)

> - #### 🤖 Automation Coverage Examples:
>    - Cypress: [Sample Tests](https://github.com/alexpeaceca/hackernews-remix-react-tests/tree/main/cypress) (Javascript), [Testscases](https://github.com/alexpeaceca/hackernews-remix-react-tests/blob/main/cypress/cypress/testcases-csv/user_anon_page_landing.csv) (CSV)
